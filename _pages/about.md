I am PhD student at The Ohio State University in the Computer Science and Engineering department studying Natural Language Processing.

My broad goals are to apply my background in Neuroscience to strengthen the scientific process in AI research, and to bridge the gap between Language Model advances and practical benefits for scientists.

My current work encompasses both autonomous, multi-domain research proposal evaluation and training dynamics with reinforcement learning in language models.
