At the Association for Computational Linguistics 2025 Conference, 25 individuals were selected from over 3,000 accepted papers to participate in 5 themed panels. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to speak on the panel covering generalization. TLDR: The generalization of interpretability-based steering methods is at an inflection point. As a community, we need to place strong emphasis on methods-reliability evals if we care about long-term impact.
